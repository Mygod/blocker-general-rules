    "description": "This service determines if the device is locked/unlocked and takes an action based on the state. A service is used to to determine this, as opposed to an activity, because the user must unlock the device before a notification can start an activity. This is not the case for a service, and intents can be sent to this service even from the lock screen. This allows users to quickly report a number as spam or not spam from their lock screen.",
